Based on the ESP32. Project came about because I was having an issue where my WiFi connection was dropping and I wasn't noticing it. This project monitors the WiFi connection, when the connection is lost a visual indication is triggered and an attempt to reconnect is made. Project includes the SSD1306 which displays the time, date, connection status, lost count lost time and reconnect time.
