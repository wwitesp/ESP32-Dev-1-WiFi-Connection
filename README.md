Based on the ESP32. Project came about because I was having an issue where my WiFi connection was dropping and I wasn't noticing it. This project monitors the WiFi connection, when the connection is lost a visual indication is triggered and an attempt to reconnect is made. Project includes the SSD1306 which displays the time, date, connection status, lost count lost time and reconnect time.

NB. This is an ongoing project and changes happen on a regular basis. I've posted this code for other to use parts of where they find useful.

I've been working on code to help with reconnection and have made some good headway. If you find the code can be simplified in any way please feel free to contact me. I'm new to coding and am always open to suggestions and improvements - Please be positive with your comments.
